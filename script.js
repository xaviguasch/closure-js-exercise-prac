Coding Challenge #2
This is more of a thinking challenge than a coding challenge 🤓 Your tasks:
1. TaketheIIFEbelowandattheendofthefunction,attachaneventlistenerthat changes the color of the selected h1 element ('header') to blue, each time the body element is clicked. Do not select the h1 element again!
2. Andnowexplaintoyourself(orsomeonearoundyou)whythisworked!Takeall the time you need. Think about when exactly the callback function is executed, and what that means for the variables involved in this example.
 

GOOD LUCK 😀
